# Beginner Python Projects  
Welcome to my messy starter pack of Python chaos. This repo is where I dump every baby project I cook up while learning the language. Nothing fancy, nothing pretentious, just raw code grinding its way toward greatness.

## What’s Inside  
A bunch of small scripts covering basics like:  
- Number manipulation  
- Variables and operators  
- Rounding, flooring, all that math kink  
- f-Strings  
- Whatever else I decide to slap in here while leveling up

## Why This Repo Exists  
Because I’m learning and I need a place to stash my code without losing it on my desktop like a rookie. Also, it’s nice to look back and see how far I’ve come instead of crying over broken syntax.

## How to Use  
Honestly, just open a `.py` file and run it. These are beginner projects, not the gates of heaven.  
If you wanna learn from them, steal whatever you want. I’m not your dad.

## Goals  
- Practice consistently  
- Build clean habits  
- Keep pushing until the code stops looking like a hot mess  
- Level up into a Python menace

## Future Plans  
More scripts, more chaos, more glow-ups. Maybe even a real project once my brain cells decide to cooperate.
